    <h3>Your Website Description</h3>
    This assignment provides opportunities to use Nodejs for back-end development. The end product is a
    dynamic website with modern styling and interesting event handling that provides a server API.
    <h2>Website Requirements</h2>
    <p>In HW4 you completed the front-end portion of your website. Now your objective
        is to <strong>implement back-end server functionality using NodeJS and any supporting packages/libraries such as Express, Supabase, Firebase, MongoDB, etc.</strong>! 
        You must create back-end features to satisfy the requirements below.</p>
    <p>You are free to add additional front-end content to make your site more complete. If you wish to choose a
        different topic than you submitted for HW4, you must create new front-end React contents for that topic.</p>
    <p>
        Complete <b>at least 3</b> of the following server feature requirements:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Serve files to the client</li>
        <li>Manipulate data in a database or data store</li>
        <li>Save and load files on the server file system</li>
        <li>Authenticate a request to login and/or maintain a persistent user session</li>
        <li>One other feature of your choice</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You may use any packages and tools for NodeJS that help to implement your website.
        You are welcome to utilize packages that we did not cover in class. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Please create a <b>new README file called "features.md"</b> that lists/summarizes the  back-end features that you have implemented. Additionally, make sure your database is <b>cloud-hosted or embedded in your application</b> and is using an appropriate public API key that allows any machine/IP address to access your database. This will allow effective grading of your submission. If the grader cannot access your database, your homework will receive a penalty.
    </p>

<section>
    <h2>Best Practice and Git Requirements</h2>
    <p>Use <strong>best practice</strong> for all back-end contents. Examples of best practice:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Choose appropriate HTTP/HTTPS routes and request methods (GET, POST, PUT, etc.) 
            based on sent data and expected operation</li>
        <li>Encrypt sensitive data before saving in a database</li>
        <li>Develop API routes to be RESTful (Independent and Stateless using HTTP/HTTPS)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Use <strong>appropriate Git practice</strong> to complete the homework. Create a branch to work on each page,
        and merge branches into main via a pull request. You may complete your own pull requests for this assignment.
